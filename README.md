# Genetic-Image-Processing-Project
Final project for SFWRENG 2S03 at McMaster University in Fall, 2018

Currently missing makefile and one other file given by the prof, which I will hope to update in the near future.

The project takes an input PPM image and uses a genetic algorithm to generate an approximation of the image over a given
number of iterations.
