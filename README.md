# SFWRENG 2S03 Genetic Algorithm Imaging Project
Final project for SFWRENG 2S03 at McMaster University in Fall, 2018

The project takes an input PPM image and uses a genetic algorithm to generate an approximation of the image over a given
number of iterations. We were given the ```makefile```, ```a4.h```, ```crossover.c```, ```main.c``` and the two image files
```mcmaster.ppm``` and ```me.ppm``` by the prof, and instructed to write the remaining files. ```mcmaster2.ppm```  and
```me2.ppm``` were both generated by my program (details of the settings used can be found in the ```makefile```.
